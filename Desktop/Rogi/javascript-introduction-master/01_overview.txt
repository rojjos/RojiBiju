Overview

JavaScript is an object-oriented dynamic language with 
types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. 
Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages â€” so many 
structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. 
One of the key differences is that JavaScript does not have 
classes; instead, the class functionality is accomplished by 
object prototypes (see more about ES6 Classes).The other main 
difference is that functions are objects, giving functions 
the capacity to hold executable code and be passed around 
like any other object.
